## Raw Data (Riot API Data) Collecting & Preprocessing Module
1. **get_match_ids.py**
    - Get match IDs from the starting point user who were in that tier.

2. **check_matchid_duplication.py**
    - Eliminate duplicate match data within different tier data (usually in continuous tier) to prevent data duplication.

3. **get_match_data.py**
    - Get match data from match IDs collected before.

4. **process_raw_data.py**
    - Process one game data to obtain difference values among blue team and red team, generating two JSON files (blue team data & red team).

5. **get_csv_format.py**
    - Combine JSON files collected before and get an integrated CSV file for each tier interval.

6. **Check_tier.py**
    - Verify that collected data for each tier interval is truly data for that tier.

## Other Python Files
- **get_match_from_challenger_gm.py**
    - Set aside for collecting upper echelons' data, specifically challenger and grandmaster tier's data.

- **concatenate_csvâ€™s.py**
    - Concatenate each tier interval's CSV file to create one integrated CSV file.

- **Csv_functions.py**
    - Contains CSV functions.

- **json_functions.py**
    - Contains JSON functions.

- **riot_api_functions.csv**
    - Contains Riot API functions.

- **combine_result_csv.py**
    - Concatenate various result CSV files then extract one integrated file.

- **Divide_csv_by_duration.csv**
    - Divide processed raw data according to the game duration (Early, Mid, Late).

- **model.py**
    - Conduct machine learning based on game data, conducting logistic regression with a pipeline + hyperparameter grid, then outputting the CSV format results.

## Data Python Files
- **Factor_list.csv.py**
    - List up and classify the used factors in our analysis.

- **Champ_tier_final.py**
    - List the champion tier according to tier interval.

## Directories
1. **"All_data_ver1", "matched_and_puuid_ver1"**
    - Deprecated directories and files. Wrongly collected data is included.

2. **Raw JSON File Directories**
    - Contain each tier interval's match data JSON files from Riot API.
    - A. "Challenger_grandmaster_data"
    - B. "Master_diamond_data"
    - C. "Diamond_emerald_data"
    - D. "Emerald_platinum_data"
    - E. "Gold_data"
    - F. "Silver_data"

3. **"check_lists"**
    - Contains CSV-format data, and each row indicates the average tier of 10 users who participated in the game.

4. **"matchid_and_puuid_ver2"**
    - Contains used match IDs and user's PUUIDs for collecting the entire dataset from Riot API.

5. **"processed_data"**
    - Contains JSON files for each tier interval. Each JSON file is blue or red team's data, output from "process_raw_data.py".

6. **"processed_raw_data"**
    - Contains CSV files for each tier interval. Each CSV file is generated by integrating the JSON files in "processed_data", output from "get_csv_format.py".

7. **"processed_time_duration_data"**
    - Contains CSV files for each tier interval and game duration interval (early, mid, and late). Each CSV file is generated by dividing the CSV files in "processed_raw_data" by "divide_csv_by_duration.py".

8. **Result CSV Directories**
    - A. "results": Contains model's result files using CSV files in "processed_raw_data".
    - B. "time_duration_results_csv": Contains model's result files using CSV files in "processed_time_duration_data".
